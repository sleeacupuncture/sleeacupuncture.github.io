Dr. Soong H. Lee was born in South Korea where he completed his degree in Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.). In the 1990’s, he came to the U.S. to complete graduate school for Veterinary Science (M.S.).
After finishing graduate school and obtaining his master’s degree, Dr. Soong H. Lee became interested in traditional Chinese medicine and medical practices. This caused him to move to Tianjin, China. There he attended Tianjin University of Chinese medicine (O.M.D.).
After studying for six years in China, he moved to the state of New York, where he has practiced acupuncture for over a decade. Adding on, Dr. Soong H. Lee was also able to develop an efficient way to diagnose and treat his patients through the use of Tuina* and Iridology* (Iris diagnosis).

*Tuina is a form of Chinese manipulative therapy often used in conjunction with acupuncture.
*Iridology (iris diagnosis) is an alternative medicine technique in which iris can be examined to determine information about a patient’s systemic health.

Blood flow, Circulation Matters

Blood flow can be disturbed by many factors, some being stress, accidents and illnesses.
This can cause physical problems as well as psychological and emotional problems.
With neck problems (incorrect posture or stress and/or neck damage), the vertebral artery located in your neck may be pressured by the surrounding tissue. This artery runs superiorly in the transverse foramen of each cervical vertebra (C1-C6). The space that this artery runs through is narrow, and can be easily disturbed by neck injuries and stress. If it is injured or compressed, then blood flow to the brain would be less, causing migraines, headaches, depression, anxiety, nausea, insomnia, etc.

N & N: (Neck and Nose) treatment
This treatment can be used to treat neck problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, rhinitis, sinusitis and asthma, etc. This treatment calibrates the spinal cord in order to prevent the compression of the vertebral artery. At same time by treating the nose, the lung qi increases to fix various respiratory diseases and malfunctions. By doing so, most problems can be solved or alleviated.

N & F: (Neck and Facial) treatment
This treatment can be applied to treat neck problems and facial rejuvenation together. This treatment heals your neck and whole spine in addition to working on your facial area. This treatment reduces stress by relaxing your facial and entire body muscles. It helps reduce wrinkles, muscle tension, tightens the skin in the face and neck. It can also stimulate collagen production to look better, younger and glowing.
